# Introduction

In this course, we will derive the Navier-Stokes equations, focusing on two key versions:

1. **The Euler equations** - for inviscid (non-viscous) flows
2. **The Navier-Stokes equations** - for viscous flows

Throughout the derivation, we will use tensor notation extensively, as it provides a compact and elegant way to represent these complex equations. Understanding tensor notation throughout the course is crucial for working with these equations effectively.

## Complete Derivation Process

1. **Control Volume Analysis**
   - Define a fixed control volume in the fluid
   - Consider mass and momentum fluxes across boundaries
   - Account for forces acting on the control volume

2. **Newton's Second Law**
   - Apply F = ma to the fluid element
   - Consider both body forces (like gravity) and surface forces
   - Express acceleration in terms of material derivative

3. **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)**
   - Relate the system derivative to control volume analysis
   - Account for temporal changes within control volume
   - Include flux terms across control surface

4. **Constitutive Relations**
   - **Newtonian fluid assumption**: $T_{ij} = -p\delta_{ij} + \mu\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right)$
   - **Stress tensor decomposition** into pressure and viscous components
   - **Material properties** (viscosity μ, density ρ)
   - **Isotropic fluid assumption** for simplification

5. **Mathematical Transformations**
   - **Gauss's theorem application** to convert surface integrals to volume integrals
   - **Divergence theorem** for momentum flux terms: $\int_S \rho u_i \vec{u} \cdot \hat{n} \, dS = \int_V \nabla \cdot (\rho u_i \vec{u}) \, dV$
   - **Stress tensor divergence**: $\int_S T_{ji} n_j \, dS = \int_V \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} T_{ji} \, dV$
   - **Tensor algebra** for stress tensor manipulation

6. **Cauchy's Equation of Motion**
   - Combine RTT with stress tensor to get: $\rho \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} (\rho u_i u_j) = \rho g_i - \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} T_{ji}$
   - **Vector form**: $\rho \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + \rho \vec{u} \cdot \nabla \vec{u} = \rho \vec{g} + \nabla \cdot \bar{\bar{T}}$

7. **Navier-Stokes Equations**
   - Substitute constitutive relations into Cauchy's equation
   - **Final form**: $\rho \left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} + u_j \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}\right) = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i} + \mu \nabla^2 u_i + \rho g_i$
   - **Vector form**: $\rho \frac{D\vec{u}}{Dt} = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \vec{u} + \rho \vec{g}$

8. **Boundary Conditions**
   - **No-slip condition**: $\vec{u} = \vec{u}_{wall}$ at solid boundaries
   - **Pressure boundary conditions** at free surfaces
   - **Inlet/outlet conditions** for flow boundaries
   - **Symmetry conditions** where applicable

## Key Mathematical Tools Used

- **Reynolds Transport Theorem**: $\frac{d}{dt} \int_{V(t)} \rho b \, dV = \int_{V(t)} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho b) \, dV + \int_{S(t)} \rho b \vec{v} \cdot \hat{n} \, dS$
- **Gauss's Theorem**: $\int_S \vec{F} \cdot \hat{n} \, dS = \int_V \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \, dV$
- **Material Derivative**: $\frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{u} \cdot \nabla$
- **Stress Tensor Symmetry**: $T_{ij} = T_{ji}$ (from angular momentum conservation)

## Physical Interpretation

- **Inertial term** ($\rho \frac{D\vec{u}}{Dt}$): Fluid acceleration
- **Pressure term** ($-\nabla p$): Force due to pressure gradients
- **Viscous term** ($\mu \nabla^2 \vec{u}$): Internal friction forces
- **Body force term** ($\rho \vec{g}$): External forces (gravity, etc.)

# Navier-Stokes Equations

## Left Hand Side Analysis

Left hand side in vector notation:

$\rho \frac{D\vec{u}}{Dt} = \rho \left(\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla)\vec{u}\right)$

This represents the acceleration of a fluid particle, combining:
- **Local acceleration**: $\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t}$ - temporal changes at a fixed point
- **Convective acceleration**: $(\vec{u} \cdot \nabla)\vec{u}$ - spatial changes as fluid moves
    - This is the difficult term to solve
    - It's non-linear
    - $(\vec{u} \cdot \nabla)$ is a scalar operator

**Continuity equation**: $\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = 0$ (incompressible flow)

**Boundary condition**: $\vec{u} = 0$ on solid surfaces $S$

# Unidirectional Flows

## Introduction

**Definition**: $\vec{u} \cdot \nabla \vec{u} = 0$ i.e., $\vec{u} \perp \nabla \vec{u}$

This means the velocity vector is perpendicular to its own gradient, eliminating the non-linear convective term.

## Vector Form

$\vec{u} = u_1(x_1, x_2, x_3, t)\hat{e}_1$

This simplification makes the derivation mathematically tractable, allowing us to focus on physical understanding rather than complex mathematics.

## Index Form Analysis

**Continuity equation**: $\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1} + 0 + 0 = 0$

This shows that $u_1$ cannot depend on $x_1$, so $u_1 = u_1(x_2, x_3, t)$.

### $\hat{x}_3$ Direction

Since $u_3 = 0$: $0 = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_3}$ → $p = p(x_1, x_2, t)$

### $\hat{x}_2$ Direction

Since $u_2 = 0$: $0 = \rho g - \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_2}$ → $p = \rho g x_2 + p_0$

### $\hat{x}_1$ Direction

$0 = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_1} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_1}{\partial x_2^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_1}{\partial x_3^2}\right)$

This leads to: $p = p(x_2, x_3, t) - \rho g_1 x_1$

## Hydrostatics

When flow is only affected by gravity and pressure:

$\Rightarrow \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_1} = \text{constant}$

$\Rightarrow \rho \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_1} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_1}{\partial x_2^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_1}{\partial x_3^2}\right)$

This is a **linear equation** - much easier to solve!

### Applications

This formulation typically solves:
- **Steady parallel flows**: Pipes, channels, etc.
- **Start-up flows**: Transient development from rest
- **Transient problems**: Driven by time-dependent boundary conditions
  - Usually approximated by infinite geometries for analytical solutions

# Pressure-Driven Flow

**Key principle**: Flow requires a pressure difference, generated by something putting energy into the system.

**Always check**: Units & boundary conditions

## Velocity Profile

For channel flow between parallel plates:

$u_1 = \frac{G h^2}{2 \mu} \left(\frac{y}{h} - \left(\frac{y}{h}\right)^2\right)$

Where $G = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_1}$ is the pressure gradient.

# Volumetric Flux

**Definition**: $Q = \int_S \vec{u} \cdot \hat{n} \, dS$

**Units**: $m^3/s$

For per-unit-width flow: $Q' = \int u \, dy$

$Q' = \int_0^h \frac{G h^2}{2 \mu} \left(\frac{y}{h} - \left(\frac{y}{h}\right)^2\right) dy$

$Q' = \frac{G h^3}{12 \mu}$

**Note**: This formula is only valid for channel flows. For pipes, the geometry factor is different (see exercise material).

# Wall Shear Stress

## Stress Tensor Component

$T_{21} = \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}$

## Calculation

At the wall ($y = h$): $T_{21} = \frac{G h}{2} > 0$

## Force on Wall

$\vec{R} = \hat{n} \cdot \bar{\bar{T}}$

The fluid exerts a force on the wall in the direction of the flow.

## Shear Stress

$\tau^{(w)} = -\hat{e}_2 \cdot \bar{\bar{T}} \cdot \hat{e}_1$

Evaluated at $y = h$: $\tau^{(w)} = \frac{G h}{2} > 0$

# Stokes' First Problem (Rayleigh Problem)

## Problem Setup

A plate of infinite extent moves with constant velocity $U$ in the $x_1$ direction.

$\vec{u}_{\text{plate}} = \begin{cases} 0 & t < 0 \\ U\hat{e}_1 & t \geq 0 \end{cases}$

## Governing Equation

$\vec{u} = u(y,t)$

$\rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}$

This describes the **diffusion of momentum** in the $x_1$ direction.

## Boundary Conditions

- $u(0,t) = U$ for $t \geq 0$ (plate velocity)
- $u(y,t) \rightarrow 0$ as $y \rightarrow \infty$ (far field)
- $u(y,0) = 0$ for $y > 0$ (initial condition)

## Solution Methods

This is a **Linear Differential Equation (LDE)** that can be solved by:
- Separation of variables
- Laplace transform
- Similarity solution (see below)

## Analytical Solution

The solution to Stokes' first problem is:

$u(y,t) = U \cdot \text{erfc}\left(\frac{y}{2\sqrt{\nu t}}\right)$

Where $\text{erfc}$ is the complementary error function and $\nu = \mu/\rho$ is the kinematic viscosity.

### Physical Interpretation

- $U$ is the plate velocity (constant)
- $y$ is the distance from the plate
- $t$ is time elapsed since the plate started moving
- $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity

The solution shows that velocity decreases rapidly with distance from the plate. The characteristic length scale $\sqrt{\nu t}$ indicates that the effect of the plate's motion diffuses outward over time, affecting fluid further away.

This is a classic example of **momentum diffusion** in a fluid, showing how viscous forces transmit motion from the moving plate into the previously stationary fluid.

## Similarity Solution Approach

### Motivation

Similarity solutions are powerful tools for solving PDEs with non-linear terms by finding coordinate transformations that reduce the PDE to an ODE.

### Similarity Variable

**Goal**: Find $\eta(y,t; \rho, \mu)$ such that the PDE becomes an ODE.

**Physical approach**: Use dimensional analysis and physical intuition

$\eta = \frac{y}{\sqrt{\nu t}}$

**Mathematical approach**: Non-dimensionalization and scaling analysis

*[Note: Complete derivation would continue here with the similarity transformation and resulting ODE solution - see other notes]*
