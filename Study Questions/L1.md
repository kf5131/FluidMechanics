## Basic Level (Understanding)

### 1. Fluid Properties

		- Gases and liquids
- Define viscosity in your own words. What are its units?
		- Viscosity is a fluids resistance to shear stressors, It's unit is Pa * S
- Explain the difference between stress and strain in fluid mechanics.
		- Stress is the force per unit area, and strain is the deformation per unit length.

### 2. Continuum Approximation
- What does the continuum approximation mean in fluid mechanics?
		- It is a fundemental assumption that we can treat a fluid as a solid continuum, instead of individual particles
- Why can't we use the continuum approximation at the molecular level?
		- At the molecular level, the fluid is not a continuum, and the fluid is made up of individual particles.
- Give an example of when the continuum approximation would break down.
		- At the molecular level, in a small enough (open) volume, i.e a pipe


### 3. Kinematics
- What are the three components of velocity in 3D Cartesian coordinates?
        - u = (u_x, u_y, u_z)
- What is the difference between a scalar field and a vector field?
		- A scalar field is a function that assigns a single value to each point in space, while a vector field is a function that assigns a vector to each point in space.
- Name the four fundamental vector operations mentioned in the lecture.
		- Gradient
		- Rotation (Curl)
		- Line integral
		- Divergence

### 4. Stress-Deformation Relationship
- Write down the constitutive relationship for fluids and explain each term.
		- $\tau = \mu \gamma$
		- $\tau$ is the stress tensor, it is a tensor that describes the stress on a fluid element
		- $\mu$ is the viscosity, it is a scalar that describes the resistance of a fluid to shear stress
		- $\gamma$ is the strain rate, it is a scalar that describes the rate of deformation of a fluid element
- What is the difference between a Newtonian and a non-Newtonian fluid?
		- A Newtonian fluid is a fluid that obeys the stress-deformation relationship, while a non-Newtonian fluid is a fluid that does not obey the stress-deformation relationship.
## Intermediate Level (Application)

### 4. Stress-Deformation Relationship
- How does viscosity affect energy dissipation in fluid flow?
		- It's proportional to the rate of deformation of a fluid element
- If a fluid has a viscosity of 0.001 Pa·s, what does this tell you about its flow behavior?
		- It's a low viscosity fluid that will flow easily and offer little resistance to shear stresses. This is typical of water-like fluids.

### 5. Mathematical Operations
- Calculate the divergence of the velocity field u = (2x, -y, 3z).
		- ∇·u = ∂(2x)/∂x + ∂(-y)/∂y + ∂(3z)/∂z = 2 + (-1) + 3 = 4
- What does a positive divergence value indicate about the fluid flow?
		- A positive divergence indicates that the fluid is expanding or that there is a net outflow of fluid from the point, meaning the fluid is being created or the volume is increasing.
- If ∇·u = 0, what does this tell you about the fluid?
		- If ∇·u = 0, the fluid is incompressible, meaning the density remains constant and there is no net creation or destruction of fluid mass at any point.

### 6. Conservation Principles
- Explain why mass conservation is fundamental to fluid mechanics.
		- Mass conservation is fundamental because it's a universal physical law that states mass cannot be created or destroyed. In fluid mechanics, this means the total mass entering a control volume must equal the total mass leaving it, plus any mass stored within it. This principle forms the basis for the continuity equation and is essential for analyzing fluid flow systems.
- What is the physical meaning of the term (u·n) in the mass flux equation?
		- The term (u·n) represents the component of velocity normal to the surface, which determines how much fluid mass crosses the surface per unit time. It's the dot product of the velocity vector with the unit normal vector to the surface, giving the velocity component perpendicular to the surface.
- How does Gauss's divergence theorem help us convert surface integrals to volume integrals?
		- Gauss's divergence theorem states that the flux of a vector field through a closed surface equals the volume integral of the divergence of that field over the enclosed volume. This allows us to convert complex surface integrals into simpler volume integrals, making it easier to analyze fluid flow problems and derive differential equations from integral forms.

## Advanced Level (Analysis & Synthesis)

### 7. Continuum Approximation Validity
- For a pipe flow with radius R = 0.1 m, estimate the minimum resolution γ needed for the continuum approximation to be valid. Assume λ ≈ 10⁻⁷ m for air.
		- For the continuum approximation to be valid, we need γ >> λ. With R = 0.1 m and λ ≈ 10⁻⁷ m, the ratio R/λ ≈ 10⁶. Therefore, any resolution γ << 0.1 m (e.g., γ < 10⁻³ m) would be sufficient for the continuum approximation to hold.
- What happens to the continuum approximation as temperature increases in a gas?
		- As temperature increases, the mean free path λ increases because gas molecules move faster and collide less frequently. This means the continuum approximation becomes less valid at higher temperatures, and we need larger characteristic lengths for it to remain applicable.
- Discuss the implications of the continuum approximation breaking down in microfluidic devices.
		- When the continuum approximation breaks down in microfluidic devices, we can no longer use standard fluid mechanics equations. We must resort to molecular dynamics simulations or kinetic theory approaches, which are computationally expensive and complex. This affects our ability to predict flow behavior, heat transfer, and mass transfer in very small devices.

### 8. Lagrangian vs Eulerian Approaches
- Why can't we directly apply F = ma to fluid particles?
		- We can't directly apply F = ma to fluid particles because fluid particles are not rigid bodies - they deform continuously, merge, and split. Additionally, we need to account for pressure forces, viscous forces, and body forces acting on the fluid element, not just external forces.
- Derive the material derivative Dρ/Dt from first principles.
		- The material derivative Dρ/Dt = ∂ρ/∂t + u·∇ρ represents the rate of change of density following a fluid particle. The first term ∂ρ/∂t is the local rate of change at a fixed point, while u·∇ρ is the convective rate of change due to the particle moving through a density gradient.
- Explain the physical meaning of each term in the material derivative equation.
		- ∂ρ/∂t: Local rate of change of density at a fixed point in space (Eulerian perspective)
		- u·∇ρ: Convective rate of change due to the fluid particle moving through spatial variations in density
- When would you choose to use the Lagrangian approach over the Eulerian approach?
		- Use the Lagrangian approach when tracking individual fluid particles (e.g., particle dispersion studies, material transport), studying particle trajectories, or when the motion of specific fluid elements is of interest. Use the Eulerian approach for analyzing flow fields at fixed points, solving boundary value problems, or when the overall flow pattern is more important than individual particle motion.

### 9. Continuity Equation
- Starting from the integral form of mass conservation, derive the differential form of the continuity equation.
		- Starting with ∫∫∫ ∂ρ/∂t dV = -∫∫ ρ(u·n) dS, applying Gauss's divergence theorem to the right side gives ∫∫∫ ∂ρ/∂t dV = -∫∫∫ ∇·(ρu) dV. Since this holds for any volume, the integrands must be equal: ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρu) = 0, which is the differential form of the continuity equation.
- What does the term ∇·u represent physically?
		- ∇·u represents the rate of expansion or compression of a fluid element. A positive value means the element is expanding (dilating), while a negative value means it's compressing. For incompressible flow, ∇·u = 0, meaning the volume of fluid elements remains constant.
- How does the continuity equation change for incompressible fluids?
		- For incompressible fluids, ρ = constant, so ∂ρ/∂t = 0 and ∇ρ = 0. The continuity equation simplifies to ∇·u = 0, meaning the velocity field is divergence-free and fluid elements maintain constant volume.
- Explain why ∇·u = (1/V)(DV/Dt) makes physical sense.
		- This relationship makes physical sense because ∇·u represents the rate of change of volume per unit volume of a fluid element. If we follow a fluid element, its volume changes at a rate DV/Dt, and dividing by the current volume V gives the fractional rate of change, which equals ∇·u.

## Challenge Level (Critical Thinking)

### 10. Advanced Applications
- Consider a fluid with density ρ(x,y,z,t) = ρ₀(1 + αx + βt). Find the velocity field u that satisfies the continuity equation.
		- Using the continuity equation ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρu) = 0, we have ∂ρ/∂t = ρ₀β and ∇ρ = ρ₀(α,0,0). For a simple case, if we assume u = (u₁,0,0), then ∇·(ρu) = ∂(ρu₁)/∂x = ρ₀(1+αx+βt)∂u₁/∂x + ρ₀αu₁. Setting this equal to -ρ₀β and solving gives u₁ = -βx/(1+αx+βt) + C(t), where C(t) is an arbitrary function of time.
- A fluid flows through a converging nozzle. Using the continuity equation, explain how the velocity changes along the nozzle.
		- In a converging nozzle, the cross-sectional area decreases along the flow direction. For incompressible flow (ρ = constant), the continuity equation becomes A₁V₁ = A₂V₂, where A is area and V is velocity. As A decreases, V must increase to maintain the same mass flow rate, so the fluid accelerates through the nozzle.
- Discuss the limitations of the stress-deformation relationship τ = μγ̇ for non-Newtonian fluids.
		- The relationship τ = μγ̇ is limited because non-Newtonian fluids have viscosity that depends on shear rate, time, or other factors. For such fluids, μ is not constant, and the relationship may be nonlinear, time-dependent, or exhibit yield stress behavior. More complex constitutive equations are needed to accurately model their behavior.

### 11. Mathematical Framework
- Prove that ∇·(ρu) = ρ∇·u + u·∇ρ using the product rule for differentiation.
		- Using the product rule: ∇·(ρu) = ∂(ρu₁)/∂x + ∂(ρu₂)/∂y + ∂(ρu₃)/∂z = ρ∂u₁/∂x + u₁∂ρ/∂x + ρ∂u₂/∂y + u₂∂ρ/∂y + ρ∂u₃/∂z + u₃∂ρ/∂z = ρ(∂u₁/∂x + ∂u₂/∂y + ∂u₃/∂z) + (u₁∂ρ/∂x + u₂∂ρ/∂y + u₃∂ρ/∂z) = ρ∇·u + u·∇ρ.
- Show that the material derivative is frame-invariant (doesn't depend on the coordinate system).
		- The material derivative D/Dt = ∂/∂t + u·∇ involves only scalar quantities and vector operations that are coordinate-independent. The time derivative ∂/∂t is invariant, and the dot product u·∇ is a scalar that doesn't depend on the choice of coordinate system.
- Derive the relationship between the rate of deformation tensor γ̇ and the velocity gradient ∇u.
		- The rate of deformation tensor γ̇ = 1/2(∇u + (∇u)ᵀ), where (∇u)ᵀ is the transpose of the velocity gradient. This represents the symmetric part of the velocity gradient, which describes how fluid elements deform without rotation.

### 12. Physical Interpretation
- How does the continuum approximation relate to the concept of a "fluid particle"?
		- The continuum approximation allows us to define "fluid particles" as small volumes that are large enough to contain many molecules but small enough to be treated as mathematical points. These particles have well-defined properties like density, velocity, and temperature, even though they're not actual physical particles.
- Explain why the stress tensor τ is symmetric in most fluid mechanics applications.
		- The stress tensor is symmetric because of the conservation of angular momentum. If τ were not symmetric, there would be net torques on fluid elements that would cause infinite angular acceleration, which is physically impossible. This symmetry is a fundamental property of Newtonian fluids.
- Discuss the connection between the material derivative and the concept of "following a fluid particle."
		- The material derivative D/Dt represents the rate of change of a property while following a fluid particle along its trajectory. It combines the local rate of change (∂/∂t) with the convective rate of change (u·∇) to give the total rate of change experienced by an observer moving with the fluid particle.

## Problem-Solving Practice

### 13. Numerical Example
Given a velocity field u = (x², -2xy, 0):
- Calculate ∇·u
		- ∇·u = ∂(x²)/∂x + ∂(-2xy)/∂y + ∂(0)/∂z = 2x + (-2x) + 0 = 0
- Find the rate of change of density at point (1,1,0) if ∂ρ/∂t = 0 and ∇ρ = (1,1,0)
		- Using the continuity equation: ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρu) + u·∇ρ = 0. Since ∂ρ/∂t = 0 and ∇·u = 0, we have u·∇ρ = 0. At point (1,1,0), u = (1,-2,0) and ∇ρ = (1,1,0), so u·∇ρ = (1)(1) + (-2)(1) + (0)(0) = 1 - 2 = -1. Therefore, the rate of change of density is 1.
- Determine if this flow is incompressible
		- Since ∇·u = 0, this flow is incompressible. The velocity field has zero divergence, meaning fluid elements maintain constant volume as they move.

### 14. Conceptual Questions
- How would you experimentally measure the viscosity of a fluid?
		- Viscosity can be measured using viscometers like capillary tubes, rotating cylinders, or falling sphere viscometers. The capillary method measures pressure drop and flow rate, the rotating cylinder method measures torque and angular velocity, and the falling sphere method measures terminal velocity of a sphere through the fluid.
- What are the implications of ∇×u ≠ 0 for fluid flow?
		- If ∇×u ≠ 0, the flow is rotational (has vorticity). This means fluid elements rotate as they move, creating eddies and swirls. Rotational flows are more complex to analyze and may require different mathematical approaches than irrotational flows.
- Explain why the continuity equation is sometimes called the "mass balance equation."
		- The continuity equation is called the "mass balance equation" because it represents a balance of mass entering, leaving, and accumulating within a control volume. It ensures that mass is neither created nor destroyed, maintaining the fundamental principle of mass conservation in fluid systems.
